  # Fraction at which to rebalance the validation data to contain entries with registers. Only valid if registers are
  #   used. Will subsample the non-register data before subsampling the overall dataset. So if your test data is, say 20%
  #   registers, your validation dataset size _before subsampling_ will be approximately
  #
  #     (1 + validation_register_rebalance_frac) * 20% 
  #
  # Leave out or set to ~ (None) to skip rebalancing or if not using registers.

  # Rate at which to subsample the validation data. Performed _after_ the register rebalancing, if any. With rebalancing,
  #   the approximate final size of the evaluation set is given by the following:
  #
  #     (1 + validation_register_rebalance_frac) * (fraction of register data) * validation_subsampling_rate
  #
  #   with the register data balance as specified by validation_register_rebalance_frac, if any.
  #
  # Can be none to avoid subsampling.
