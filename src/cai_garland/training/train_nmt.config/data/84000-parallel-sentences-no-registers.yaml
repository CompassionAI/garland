  # Rate at which to subsample the validation data. Performed _after_ the register rebalancing, if any. With rebalancing,

  #     (1 + validation_register_rebalance_frac) * (fraction of register data) * validation_subsampling_rate
  #
  #   with the register data balance as specified by validation_register_rebalance_frac, if any.

  # Can be none to avoid subsampling.
